                Using the killing of Kirov, Stalin began arresting other innocent political members
                and forming staged trials for others. In these staged trials people were tortured
                behind the scenes into falsely admitting to the crimes in court.

                Altogether the Purges helped to maintain Stalin’s authority and further intimidate
                any other political members. The Great Terror is sometimes thought of as the crime
                of the century, as estimated deaths near 1 million.
