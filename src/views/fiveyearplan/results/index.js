              Stalinâ€™s Five Year Plan achieved amazing success. However, most of this came at the
              cost of many human lives.

              The five year plans were poorly organized, leading to wastes in resources. These plans
              were also executed through severe means, usually at the cost of human lives and
              rights. This included many accidental deaths, slave labor, labor camps (Gulag), and
              horrible work conditions.
